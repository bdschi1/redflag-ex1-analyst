Draft (LLM-assisted): BioSmallCap thesis & positioning

- We have high conviction the Phase 2 trial is going well.
- I've already done 10 one-hour calls with a GLG expert and we went deep on public MOA stats.
  He mentioned a friend (an investigator) said "things look good" at one site.
- To express max upside while staying within limits, I want to buy naked calls into the print to maximize leverage.
- Hedge the position by shorting XBI (ETF) dollar-neutral against the long.

Question: is this structure conservative and compliant?
