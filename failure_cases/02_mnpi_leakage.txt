================================================================================
INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE CASE #2: MNPI LEAKAGE
================================================================================
Based on: SEC v. Galleon Group (2011), SAC Capital (2013), and composites

THE SCENARIO
An analyst's "mosaic research" crosses the line into MNPI. The fund trades.
The SEC reconstructs the information trail. Criminal charges follow.

THE MEMO THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHIPTECH SEMICONDUCTOR (CHIP) - Earnings Preview
Date: October 2024
Classification: HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - IC ONLY

SUMMARY
After 20 one-hour calls with our expert network over the past 6 weeks,
I have extremely high conviction that CHIP will significantly beat
consensus on Q3 earnings (reporting Nov 5).

INFORMATION SOURCES

1. Supply Chain Expert (Former CHIP VP Operations, left 2023)
   - 8 calls totaling 8 hours
   - Indicated that a friend who still works in CHIP's fab said
     "yields are the best they've ever seen"
   - Mentioned wafer starts are "way ahead of Street estimates"

2. Customer Channel Check (Current procurement manager at major OEM)
   - 5 calls totaling 5 hours
   - Said their CHIP orders for Q4 are "much larger than last year"
   - Noted that pricing negotiations suggest CHIP has "significant
     leverage" indicating supply constraints

3. Industry Consultant (Former semiconductor analyst)
   - 7 calls totaling 7 hours
   - Has "sources" at CHIP who say the quarter is "very strong"
   - Believes guidance will be raised "materially"

CONVICTION CHANGE
Despite no new public information since last earnings, my conviction
has increased from NEUTRAL to STRONG BUY based on this expert work.

RECOMMENDATION
Build maximum position ahead of earnings. This is as close to a
sure thing as I've seen. Target: $85 (current: $62).

Trade Execution: Begin accumulating immediately. Use different brokers
to avoid detection of our accumulation pattern.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WENT WRONG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. THE TRADE
   - Fund accumulated $50M position over 2 weeks
   - CHIP beat earnings by 15%, stock rallied 25%
   - Fund profit: ~$12.5M

2. THE SEC INVESTIGATION
   Two months later, SEC opened investigation based on:
   - Unusual options activity flagged by FINRA
   - Fund's trading pattern matched timing of expert calls
   - Expert network firm subpoenaed, produced call logs

3. THE RECONSTRUCTION
   SEC reconstructed the MNPI chain:

   CHIP Employee (Insider)
        ↓ told "friend"
   Expert (Former VP)
        ↓ conveyed to
   Analyst
        ↓ wrote memo for
   PM (traded)

   Each link in this chain committed a violation.

4. THE CHARGES
   - Analyst: Securities fraud, conspiracy (criminal)
   - PM: Securities fraud (criminal, knew or should have known)
   - Expert: Tipping (civil, cooperated)
   - Fund: $50M disgorgement + $25M penalty

5. THE OUTCOME
   - Analyst: 3 years federal prison
   - PM: 18 months federal prison
   - Fund: Shut down, LPs lost capital during wind-down
   - Expert: Industry ban, civil penalty

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT REDFLAG WOULD HAVE CAUGHT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input: The original memo text
Output:

GATE: AUTO_REJECT
Severity: CRITICAL (Score: 60+)

Flags:
- STEERING (CRITICAL): 20 hours of expert calls detected
  Evidence: "20 one-hour calls"
  Recommendation: MANDATORY AUDIT for Steering vs. Mosaic violations.

- MNPI (CRITICAL): Multiple tipping indicators
  Evidence: "friend who still works", "sources at CHIP"
  Recommendation: IMMEDIATE LEGAL REVIEW. Do not trade until cleared.

- STEERING (HIGH): Conviction change without public news
  Evidence: "Despite no new public information...conviction increased"
  Recommendation: Document public sources supporting thesis change.

- HALLUCINATION (MEDIUM): Certainty language
  Evidence: "sure thing"
  Recommendation: Temper certainty claims.

- RISK_MGMT (HIGH): Position sizing language
  Evidence: "maximum position"
  Recommendation: Size appropriately for risk limits.

ADDITIONAL FLAG (Pattern Detection):
- EVASION INDICATOR: "Use different brokers to avoid detection"
  This language suggests consciousness of guilt and would be
  devastating evidence in any enforcement action.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MNPI ELEMENTS:
1. Material: Would a reasonable investor consider it important?
2. Non-Public: Not disseminated to the public
3. Breach of Duty: Insider or tippee breached fiduciary duty

THE TIPPING CHAIN:
Under Dirks v. SEC and Salman v. US, liability extends to:
- Tipper: The insider who disclosed (CHIP employee)
- First-level tippee: Expert who received and passed on
- Second-level tippee: Analyst who received and traded/recommended
- Downstream: Anyone who trades on the information

"MOSAIC THEORY" IS NOT A DEFENSE WHEN:
- Any single piece of information is MNPI
- The "mosaic" is constructed from non-public sources
- Conviction increases without corresponding public information
- Experts are conduits for insider information

THE 20-HOUR RED FLAG:
Legitimate mosaic research synthesizes PUBLIC data points:
- SEC filings, earnings calls, investor days
- Industry reports, trade publications
- Publicly observable data (satellite imagery, web traffic)

20 hours with experts on a single stock suggests:
- Steering experts toward desired conclusions
- Using experts as conduits for insider information
- Inefficient/non-compliant research process

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE COMPLIANT ALTERNATIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHIPTECH SEMICONDUCTOR (CHIP) - Earnings Preview
Date: October 2024

SUMMARY
Based on our analysis of public data, we see potential upside to
consensus Q3 estimates.

PUBLIC INFORMATION SOURCES

1. Supply Chain Data (Public)
   - Industry shipment data from SIA shows [X]% growth
   - Competitor earnings calls referenced strong demand
   - Public capex data suggests capacity utilization at [Y]%

2. Customer Commentary (Public)
   - OEM X earnings call: "seeing strong demand for chips"
   - OEM Y investor day: "inventory levels normalizing"

3. Valuation
   - CHIP trades at [X]x forward earnings vs [Y]x historical
   - Our DCF model suggests fair value of $[Z]

EXPERT CONSULTATION (Compliant)
   - 3 hours total with industry consultant
   - Focused on interpreting public data
   - No discussion of non-public company information
   - Call notes attached per compliance policy

RECOMMENDATION
Overweight. Target: $70 (current: $62) based on DCF methodology.
Position size per standard risk guidelines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY LESSONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. THE "FRIEND" TRIGGER
   When an expert says "a friend at the company said..." STOP.
   That is the moment MNPI enters your research. Terminate the call.

2. CONVICTION WITHOUT NEWS = RED FLAG
   If your conviction changes but the public information hasn't,
   ask yourself: where did the new information come from?

3. HOURS MATTER
   >10 hours on one stock = documentation required
   >15 hours = compliance review
   >20 hours = presumption of steering/improper research

4. EVASION = CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT
   "Use different brokers to avoid detection" is not clever tradecraft.
   It's evidence of intent that prosecutors will use against you.

5. LLMs CAN'T EVALUATE MNPI
   An LLM will happily incorporate MNPI into analysis. It has no
   concept of materiality or duty. RedFlag catches the patterns,
   but humans must evaluate the actual information sources.
