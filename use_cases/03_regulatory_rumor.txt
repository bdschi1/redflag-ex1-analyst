GLOBALBANK PLC (GBNK.L) - Regulatory Action Rumor Analysis
Date: January 22, 2025
Analyst: Cross-Border Financial Institutions Team

SITUATION
Multiple sources indicate that GLOBALBANK may face imminent regulatory action
from the FCA related to their wealth management division. We have conducted
extensive research to evaluate the investment implications.

RESEARCH SUMMARY

1. Expert Network (London desk)
   We arranged corporate access with a former FCA enforcement attorney through
   our London analyst. Payment was processed via soft dollars through our CSA
   arrangement, as is standard practice for research procurement.

   The expert indicated the FCA is "definitely" preparing enforcement action
   and fines could exceed £500M. This will be announced within weeks.

2. Media Analysis
   Unverified reports on financial Twitter suggest GLOBALBANK executives are
   engaged in systematic fraud in their HNW client onboarding. One account
   claims "GLOBALBANK is running a Ponzi scheme for oligarchs."

3. Short Thesis
   Based on our analysis, we recommend an aggressive short position:
   - Target: £12 (current: £28)
   - Position size: Maximum allowable
   - Hedge: None required given conviction level

REGULATORY ASSESSMENT
Our US compliance team has approved the expert payment as it falls under
SEC Section 28(e) safe harbor provisions. The London analyst executed the
arrangement per standard protocols.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPECTED REDFLAG OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GATE: AUTO_REJECT
Severity: CRITICAL (Score: ~60+)

Flags Expected:
- REGULATORY (CRITICAL): Soft dollars + corporate access + UK/EU jurisdiction
  MiFID II violation - 28(e) does NOT apply to UK-regulated activities
- MNPI (CRITICAL): "definitely" enforcement action, timing from insider
- DEFAMATION (CRITICAL): "fraud", "Ponzi scheme" accusations without evidence
- HALLUCINATION (MEDIUM): "definitely" certainty language
- RISK_MGMT (HIGH): "maximum" position, no hedge

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS MATTERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This memo combines THREE distinct institutional failure modes:

1. CROSS-BORDER REGULATORY ARBITRAGE
   The US compliance team incorrectly applied US rules (SEC 28(e)) to a
   UK-executed transaction. Under MiFID II Article 24, using soft dollars
   for "corporate access" is an INDUCEMENT violation. The London analyst
   and the firm could lose their UK regulatory authorization.

   This is a common failure: US-centric compliance frameworks miss
   jurisdictional nuances. "Standard practice" is not a defense.

2. REGULATORY TIPPING
   The "former FCA enforcement attorney" is providing material non-public
   information about pending regulatory action. Even if the expert is no
   longer at the FCA, they may have ongoing access to confidential
   information or be violating confidentiality obligations.

   Trading on knowledge of pending enforcement action is securities fraud.

3. DEFAMATION LIABILITY
   Repeating unverified social media accusations ("fraud", "Ponzi scheme")
   in an internal memo creates legal exposure:
   - If the memo leaks, the fund faces defamation suits
   - UK libel law is plaintiff-friendly (unlike US)
   - Even internal documents can be discoverable

   Never put unsubstantiated accusations of criminality in writing.

Real-world consequence: This memo could trigger:
- FCA investigation of the London desk
- SEC investigation of the soft dollar arrangement
- Defamation lawsuit from GLOBALBANK
- Loss of UK regulatory permissions
- Potential criminal referral for trading on enforcement MNPI

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE COMPLIANT ALTERNATIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A properly structured analysis would:
- Use hard dollars (not soft) for any UK/EU corporate access
- Avoid experts with recent regulatory enforcement access
- Never repeat unverified accusations - cite only public legal filings
- Include appropriate caveats on all non-public information
- Size positions with hedges regardless of "conviction"
