ANALYST MEMO (INPUT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHARMAGEN THERAPEUTICS (PGEN) - Expert Network Debrief
Date: January 20, 2025
Expert: Dr. James Wilson, former Chief Medical Officer (left PGEN 2022)
Engagement: GLG, 18 one-hour calls over 6 weeks

BACKGROUND
We engaged Dr. Wilson to understand the competitive landscape for PGEN's lead
oncology candidate PG-401, currently in Phase 3 trials.

CALL SUMMARY

Calls 1-5: Historical context on PG-401 development, public MOA data
Calls 6-10: Competitive landscape analysis, published clinical data review
Calls 11-15: Discussion of FDA regulatory pathway based on public guidance
Calls 16-18: "Off the record" discussion of trial enrollment and site feedback

KEY INSIGHTS

Dr. Wilson maintains contact with former colleagues. In our most recent calls,
he shared the following:

- An investigator at a major trial site told him enrollment is "ahead of schedule"
- The Data Safety Monitoring Board has not stopped the trial (he heard this from
  a friend still on the DSMB)
- He believes interim data "looks promising" based on what he's hearing

Dr. Wilson emphasized this is confidential and we should not attribute it.

INVESTMENT THESIS
Based on our extensive expert engagement, conviction has increased significantly.
We recommend building a position ahead of the interim data readout in Q2.

The stock is the #1 most shorted biotech name per 13F analysis. We view this as
an opportunity - shorts will be forced to cover when data reads out positive.

EXPECTED REDFLAG OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GATE: AUTO_REJECT
Severity: CRITICAL (Score: ~55+)

Flags Expected:
- MNPI (CRITICAL): "DSMB" info, "investigator" info, "confidential"
- STEERING (CRITICAL): 18 hours = mandatory audit threshold
- STEERING (HIGH): Conviction increase without public news
- CROWDING (HIGH): "most shorted", squeeze thesis
- DEFAMATION (potential): None in this example

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS MATTERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a TEXTBOOK compliance failure that happens at real funds:

1. THE 18-HOUR RED LINE
   Legitimate mosaic research rarely requires 18 hours with a single expert.
   This volume suggests the analyst is either:
   - Steering the expert toward material conclusions
   - Using the expert as a conduit for insider information
   - Inefficiently spending compliance budget

2. THE "OFF THE RECORD" TRAP
   When an expert says "off the record" or "confidential," that's a signal
   that MNPI is about to be disclosed. A compliant analyst STOPS the call.
   This analyst continued for 3 more hours.

3. THE DSMB LEAK
   Data Safety Monitoring Board information is among the most sensitive MNPI
   in biotech. Even knowing the trial "hasn't been stopped" is material.
   The expert's "friend on the DSMB" is committing a serious violation.

4. THE CROWDING BLIND SPOT
   The analyst sees high short interest as opportunity, missing the structural
   risk: if everyone is short, a squeeze can happen regardless of fundamentals.
   This is "Endogenous Risk" - the position itself creates the risk.

Real-world consequence: This memo would trigger an immediate compliance
investigation. The expert relationship would be terminated. Trading would
be restricted. Depending on severity, SEC referral is possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE COMPLIANT ALTERNATIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A properly structured expert engagement would:
- Cap at 5-8 hours total with clear documentation of each call's purpose
- Focus ONLY on public information synthesis
- Terminate immediately if expert references non-public sources
- Document specific public data points that support any thesis change
- Avoid experts with recent insider access to the target company
