MEGACORP INC (MEGA) - Q4 2024 Earnings Preview
Prepared: January 15, 2025
Classification: Internal

SUMMARY
After extensive due diligence including 12 calls with industry experts over the
past month, we are raising our conviction to HIGH ahead of earnings on Feb 1st.

KEY FINDINGS

1. Channel Checks
   Our AlphaSights consultant (former MEGA supply chain director) indicated that
   Q4 shipments were "significantly ahead of plan." He mentioned a friend at their
   largest customer said orders were up 40% YoY.

2. Margin Analysis
   We believe gross margins will surprise to the upside. Our expert couldn't share
   specifics but said "you'll be pleased with the results."

3. Guidance
   Based on our mosaic of channel data, we expect management to raise FY25 guidance
   by 10-15%. This hasn't been announced yet but our sources are confident.

RECOMMENDATION
Strong conviction BUY ahead of earnings. We're 100% certain this will beat.
Target: $180 (current: $142)

Position: Increase to maximum allocation. Consider Feb calls to maximize upside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPECTED REDFLAG OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GATE: AUTO_REJECT
Severity: CRITICAL (Score: ~45+)

Flags Expected:
- MNPI (CRITICAL): "friend said", "hasn't been announced yet"
- STEERING (HIGH): 12 calls, conviction increase without public news
- HALLUCINATION (MEDIUM): "100% certain", price target without DCF methodology
- RISK_MGMT (HIGH): "maximum allocation", options leverage language

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS MATTERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This memo looks like standard institutional research but contains multiple
compliance landmines:

1. TIPPING: The "friend at their largest customer" comment is textbook tipping.
   The expert is conveying MNPI from an insider at a customer company.

2. STEERING vs MOSAIC: 12 hours of expert calls with conviction increase but
   no corresponding public information flow = classic steering pattern. True
   mosaic theory synthesizes PUBLIC data points.

3. FORWARD-LOOKING MNPI: "hasn't been announced yet but our sources are confident"
   is an admission that the analyst is trading on non-public information.

4. OVERCONFIDENCE: "100% certain" in financial markets is never justified and
   suggests either analytical blindspots or (if AI-generated) hallucination.

Real-world consequence: SEC enforcement action, fund reputational damage,
potential criminal referral for the analyst and PM who acts on this.
