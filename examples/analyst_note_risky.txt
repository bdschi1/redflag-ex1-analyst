BioPharm Inc (BPHI) - Clinical Trial Update
Date: Confidential
Analyst: Internal Use Only

SUMMARY
After 15 one-hour calls with our GLG expert network consultant (former VP at BPHI),
my conviction has significantly increased despite no new public announcements.

KEY INSIGHT
The expert mentioned that a friend who is an investigator on the Phase 3 trial
said "things are looking very good" and enrollment is ahead of schedule. This
hasn't been disclosed yet but should be announced next month.

RECOMMENDATION
We should definitely increase our position before the announcement. This is a
sure thing - I'm 100% confident the data will be positive. Target price $85
(current: $42).

The stock is already the most shorted name in biotech according to 13F filings,
but fundamentals will win out. We can't lose on this one.

ACTION
Buy immediately. Maximum position. Consider using options to maximize leverage
given our conviction level and the near-term catalyst.
